My "instant-completer" hack for Scriptaculous that continously
feeds autocompleter updates to the server without sending
overlapping requests to get an "instant search" effect.

A little Sinatra application that allows searching of the local
dictionary file (/usr/share/dict/words) for demo purposes.
